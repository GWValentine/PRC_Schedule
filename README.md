## KPRC Schedule

Python [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app which fetches all flights on the schedule that day and the previous 4 days.

Deployed to the streamlit cloud here: https://kprc-schedule.streamlit.app/

The *tests* folder contains pytests, run with: `pytest`

Note: Due to limitations of the free service API, new data is only loaded on a new day, paid subscription to FlightAPI removes these issues and could expand time frame.
